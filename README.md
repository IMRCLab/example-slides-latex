Examples for creating slides/presentations

## Software

Compile locally using texlive; a good IDE is VSCode with the LaTeX Workshop extension. Another option is to use Overleaf.
Note that videos cannot be embedded and need to be stored alongside the PDF in a relative path.

## Present

Use pympress (https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress) to present. At the moment, auto-starting videos does not work, see https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress/issues/212. Since I prefer all videos to autostart, I use my own fork that auto-starts and mutes all videos, which is available at https://github.com/whoenig/pympress.

### Important keys
